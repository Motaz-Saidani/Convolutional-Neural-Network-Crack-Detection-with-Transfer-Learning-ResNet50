# Convolutional-Neural-Network-Crack-Detection-with-Transfer-Learning-ResNet50
Crack detection has vital importance for structural health monitoring and inspection. In this notebook, I will build an image classifier using specific blocks from the ResNet50 layers and evaluate its performance using only one epoch. Images with cracks are denoted as positive and images without cracks as negative.
